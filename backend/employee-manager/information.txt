To make Java Spring Boot launch you have to RUN terminal in admin and input: "net start MySQL95"
for JAVA SPRING BOOT to launch.

WARNING THIS DELETES THE WHOLE DATABASE !!!

Stop your Spring Boot app completely.
Make sure DB is clean again:
TRUNCATE TABLE employee;
ALTER TABLE employee AUTO_INCREMENT = 1;
UPDATE employee_seq SET next_val = 1;

Verify:
SELECT * FROM employee;
SELECT * FROM employee_seq;
SHOW TABLE STATUS LIKE 'employee';

Start Spring Boot again.

On POSTMAN if you initiated POST: "http://localhost:8080/employee/add" and it adds employees with id not in order then
use these commands in your local database, you have to be logged into ur own MYSQL.

-- 1. Make sure you are using the correct database
USE employeemanager;

-- 2. Clear the employee data
TRUNCATE TABLE employee;

-- 3. Reset the sequence counter to 1
-- (Use the correct column name if it's not 'next_val')
UPDATE employee_seq SET next_val = 1;

-- 4. Verify the sequence has been reset
SELECT * FROM employee_seq;
